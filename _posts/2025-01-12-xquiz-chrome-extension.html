<blockquote>A Chrome extension that turns passive scrolling into active learning</blockquote>

<p>I built <a href="https://github.com/rishabhranawat/xquiz">XQuiz</a>, a Chrome extension that generates AI-powered quiz questions based on the content you scroll past on Twitter/X. The idea is to enhance focus and information retention while browsing.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>We scroll through enormous amounts of information on social media, but how much do we actually retain? Most content passes through our attention without sticking. What if we could turn that passive consumption into active learning?</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Content Tracking</strong>: The extension monitors tweets as you scroll through your feed</li>
<li><strong>AI Question Generation</strong>: Using Google's Gemini API, it generates quiz questions (multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank) based on what you've seen</li>
<li><strong>Assessment</strong>: Periodic quizzes test your retention of the content</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong>: Track your scores, accuracy, and answer streaks over time</li>
</ol>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Customizable frequency</strong>: Adjust how often quizzes appear</li>
<li><strong>Attention timer</strong>: Set thresholds for when content counts as "viewed"</li>
<li><strong>Video-hiding mode</strong>: Optional feature to reduce distractions</li>
<li><strong>Quiz history</strong>: Review past questions and your performance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical Stack</h3>

<ul>
<li>Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)</li>
<li>Service worker backend for background processing</li>
<li>Content script for page monitoring</li>
<li>Side panel UI for quiz interface</li>
<li>Google Gemini API for question generation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Development Note</h3>

<p>This project was built entirely with AI agents as a coding companion, exploring how far AI-assisted development can go for a complete, functional product.</p>
