<blockquote>A heuristic search algorithm for finding optimal sequences</blockquote>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Beam search is a heuristic search algorithm commonly used in sequence-to-sequence models for tasks like machine translation, speech recognition, and text generation. It explores a graph by expanding the most promising nodes while keeping only a limited number of candidates at each level.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Beam search uses breadth-first search to build its search tree. At each level:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate all successors of the states at the current level</li>
<li>Sort them in increasing order of heuristic cost</li>
<li>Keep only the top \(\beta\) states (the beam width)</li>
<li>Expand only those states in the next iteration</li>
</ol>

<p>The greater the beam width, the fewer states are pruned. With \(\beta = 1\), beam search becomes greedy search. With \(\beta = \infty\), it becomes exhaustive breadth-first search.</p>

<h3>Why Use Beam Search?</h3>

<p>Beam search maintains tractability in large systems with insufficient memory to store the entire search tree. It provides a balance between:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Greedy search</strong>: Fast but may miss optimal solutions</li>
<li><strong>Exhaustive search</strong>: Optimal but computationally infeasible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applications</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Neural Machine Translation</strong>: Finding the most likely translation</li>
<li><strong>Speech Recognition</strong>: Decoding audio to text</li>
<li><strong>Image Captioning</strong>: Generating descriptions for images</li>
<li><strong>Text Generation</strong>: Producing coherent sequences in LLMs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>Beam search is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution since it prunes the search space. The choice of beam width \(\beta\) is a trade-off between search quality and computational cost.</p>
