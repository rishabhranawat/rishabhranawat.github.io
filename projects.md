<h2>Open Source</h2>

<strong><a href="https://github.com/rishabhranawat/DataRater">DataRater</a></strong><br>
<p class="message">
	Open-source implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17895">DataRater</a> (NeurIPS 2025), a meta-learning framework for automated dataset curation. The system learns to assess individual data point quality and reweight training samples to improve model training efficiency. Built with PyTorch, featuring extensible model and dataset registration.

<strong><a href="https://github.com/rishabhranawat/DataMixer">DataMixer</a></strong><br>
<p class="message">
	A Python library for combining multiple datasets using customizable algorithms. Implements research-backed approaches including UniMax (Chung et al., 2023) for multilingual pretraining and UtiliMax (Held et al., 2025) for utility-based data mixing. Provides a modular framework separating combination strategies from sampling logic.

<h2>Academic Projects</h2>

<strong><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/documents/speeding-svt.pdf">Speeding Up Singular Value Thresholding</a></strong><br>
<p class="message">
	Analysis of the Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) algorithm for matrix completion proposed by Cai et al. Evaluated performance of the algorithm and its SVD variants on randomly generated matrices, geodesic distance matrices, and student learning datasets.
</p>

<strong><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/documents/discriminator-gans.pdf">Generative Adversarial Networks: Using the Discriminator as a Classifier</a></strong><br>
with Arvi Gjoka and Yun Bin Zhang <br>
<p class="message">
	Investigated how well a GAN discriminator can act as an independent classifier. Ran experiments comparing discriminator classification performance against VGG on image classification tasks.
