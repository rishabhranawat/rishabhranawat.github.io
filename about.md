	Hi, I'm Rishabh. I'm a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> based in California. I completed my M.S. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> in 2023, and graduated from <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a> in 2018 where I studied Math and Computer Science at the <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/">Courant Institute</a>.
</p>

I use this space to document:

* Notes on papers I read (ML, reinforcement learning, data-centric AI)
* Technical projects and open-source work
* Ideas and explorations in software engineering
